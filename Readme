Are you tired of having manually open a new tab, and start up netflix? Do you have $80 laying around to spend on a Leap Motion? Have I got the perfect application for you.

Leapflix uses a leap motion to detect a users hand. When a hand is detected, Leapflix will automatically open a new tab of Netflix to satisfy your consumption needs.
